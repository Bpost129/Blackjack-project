**Wild West Blackjack** is a dastardly take on the timeless game of blackjack. The goal is simple, get to 21! That's not the only way to win though. So long as the cards in your hand are higher than the dealer's (and not over 21), then those chips are yours for the taking. If the opposite is true, the chips go to the house. If your cards and the dealer's have the same value, your bet is returned for a "push".
